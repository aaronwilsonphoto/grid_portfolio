    <h2>Loveland Living Planet Aquarium</h2>

    <h3>Employee Communications Network</h3>

    <p>The Loveland Living Planet Aquarium (LLPA) is a non-profit organization, dedicated to inspiring people to explore, discover and learn about Earth’s diverse ecosystems. They provide countless educational opportunities to understand and respect our precious Earth and its living ecosystems, from the Utah deserts and mountains, to rain forest habitats, to the planet’s vast oceans.</p>

    <p>The LLPA has a large facility, with numerous departments, all working as a whole to provide a unique, positive, fun, and educational experience for visitors of all ages. The LLPA Administration expressed their need for a more effective form of internal communication among employees.</p> 

    <p>There was a need for a universal, fast, secure, and efficient way to communicate with employees. Many instances would arise, in which staff members need to communicate with personnel in other departments, be it an urgent situation that needs immediate attention or an update that needs recognition.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Sea something, Say something”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Our goal was to design a custom web-based communication system to be used by all employees at the LLPA. The LLPA motto of "Sea Something, Say Something" was something that we kept in mind while designing for these employees. The system was also designed with consistent colors, fonts, and other elements found in the LLPA style guide.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Agile-Based Development Method</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To begin the project, we needed to lay everything out for the Aquarium Admins in a comprehensive document that would provide them with all the information needed to initiate the project, manage expectations, and stay on schedule. We needed to make sure that we were all on the same page.</p>

        <a href="/assets/files/proposal.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>This was accomplished by drafting a proposal that needed the approval and signature of Vice President, Chris O’Meara. This proposal states the need for the web-based communication app. Project goals success metrics, deliverables, and technology requirements are all included. As we used an AGILE method to complete our project, many iterations of the project were designed, developed, tested, and then re-designed again.</p>

    <p>Following the project initiation and sign-off of our proposal, our group set up a series of collaboration methods including Trello boards, Slack, GitHub, and shared Box.com folders. These resources allowed us to continue collaboration throughout our design and development process for the entirety of the project.</p>

    <p>Setting up collaboration methods and creating a rough timeline to keep track of important
    milestones was crucial during our project planning to ensure that we would complete our design sprints on time.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Sketches, Wireframes, & Prototypes</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Research began with the assessment of current communication apps that are already in use in industry today. Some of those apps included: Slack, Gmail, Flock, and Helpdesk.</p>

      <p>As our designs began to take a good direction, and problems were thought through and solved; we began to take our sketches to Adobe XD and Sketch.</p>

    <p>The common element that we, as a team, agreed upon was the addition of a user dashboard that would house any messages that were sent or received. Slack provided a great example of how this feature could help our users communicate more effectively.</p>

    <p>We began sketching for desktop admin view first since they had more capabilities than staff members, thus it would be a more complex design with micro-interactions. Including accepting or declining messages sent by staff members from their own department. Sketching our desktop view of the admin main dashboard was the first step, followed by the teams and departments.</p> 
    <p>Admins and staff members needed a main dashboard to see all incoming and outgoing messages, the idea of multiple dashboards was one that was thought through and eventually dismissed as a possible future addition.</p>

    <p>The custom ticketing program we created to meet the needs of the LLPA provided all employees their own individual profile, using their employee email address (volunteers use their own personal email address).</p> 

    <p>Each admin(s), within each department, has the ability to send/receive messages from other admins from the same department or other departments. The main dashboard displays new messages as they are sent/received/approved by admins. Each employee can send messages to other departments or individuals upon admin approval (within their respective departments).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Development</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In the beginning of the project, it was thought that it would be a fairly straight forward web app. As we began to design and later develop we found that there were far more complex problems to solve than simply creating an internal communications network for the Aquarium.</p>

    <p>Having 10 different departments, a messaging approval system, and creating admin vs. employee accounts all added to our project scope. Even with all the planning and design, certain issues could not really be thought out until they were actually developed.</p>

      <p>CodeIgniter is a powerful PHP framework with a very small footprint</p>
    </div>

    <p>For this project we decided that the PHP framework CodeIgniter would be a good fit. CodeIgniter is a powerful PHP framework with a very small footprint, built for developers who need a simple and elegant toolkit to create full-featured web applications.</p>

    <p>Previous to this project I had only worked with the Laravel PHP Framework but from that experience I was able to quickly learn CodeIgniter.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Idle hands build nothing that you can call your own"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>At the beginning of the project I was thinking this project was going to be pretty easy and that it wasn’t really going to be a challenge. I was  wrong, this project was definitely a challenge.</p> 

    <p>The biggest challenge was working in a group that was spread out with very diverse schedules. I have worked in groups at work, however we all work the same shift in the same office so getting feedback or assistance is relatively simple. In this group, because we were so spread out, getting advice or feedback was not as immediate, even with all of our established lines of communication.</p> 

    <p>Additionally, this project could have used another developer or two. With this additional resource, we could have been able to complete the project faster which would have allowed for more testing time. Overall I’m proud of the work we completed.</p>
